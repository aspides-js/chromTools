Why chromTools?
===============

Using multiple different epigenetic data types as input, chromatin state annotation algorithms segment and annotate the genome based on the combination of epigenetic marks found at each genomic position, assigning a chromatin state label to each segment. However, there are currently no generally agreed-upon statistics to determine the quality of a particular annotation.

While tools have been developed to evaluate the characteristics of an annotation, the accuracy of the derived chromatin state labels is also reliant upon a robust input dataset that represents a complete set of marks across the genome. chromTools complete aims to provide the user with the ability to assesses the extent to which their epigenetic dataset captures the complete set of marks, using a subsampling approach to estimate the number of reads required to approach the complete sampling of the mark
